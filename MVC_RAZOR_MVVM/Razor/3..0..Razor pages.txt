In order to save the pizza , we will add the entity framework core to our brand new pages app

 ............ Piza deleivery app .........................

Simplified and easier to use page-based web app programming model  that focuses on using a file based
rooting approach eliminating much of the work load asp.net mvc contributes

this also keeps ui and buisness logic separated but still within thesame page

Razor page is the recomended way to create new  page base or form based apps for developers new
to asp.net core

It provides a more accessible starting point than asp.net core mvc 

Benefits 
       -Quickly build and update the ui code for the page is kept with the page while keeping 
	ui and business logic concerns separate

	-testable and scalable to large apps 
	-Keep ASP.NET Core pages organized in a more straightforward way than asp.net mvc
	-View specific logic and view models can be kept together in their namespace and directory
	-Groups of related pages can be kept in their namespace and directory
