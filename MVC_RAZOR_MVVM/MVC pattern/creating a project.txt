Here you can choose a razor , blazor and any other available template

We'll work with the MVC 

............MVC...................... 
  Model-View-Controller(MVC) is a software design pattern commomly used for developing user 
  interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements.   
	

Model : Contains data that is represented by the view 
View  : Is responsible for presenting the model(data) and handle user interactions 
Controller  : Manages the presentation and model


................How MVC works...................
- when you visit broser
- You send a Request to the dot net 
-  Request is sent to controller(e.g the home controller depending on the logic
- Then graps some data from the database as a model(the data the user is interested in )
-After that , the model will be passed to a view (what the user interacts with (user interface )
-And that will get in return 

 USER ----request--->   ## Controller ##   ----data-->   ## Model ##    ----pass-->  ## View ##  ---Response--> USER


 A user can still click a button on the view and it'll send a request to the controller and the cycle with repeat
